# Udacity's C Course

This repository contains the code I've written for the Udacity's C Course.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four sections.


### [**Lesson 1**](./lesson1/)  Data Types, Operators, and Control Structures in C
 Understand the basics of C: data types, operators, and control structures. Interactive exercises included to reinforce key concepts and facilitate hands-on learning.

### [**Lesson 2**](./lesson2/)  Functions, Arrays, and Pointers
Explore the basics of functions, pointers, and arrays with hands-on exercises to enhance understanding and practical coding skills in this comprehensive lesson.

### [**Lesson 3**](./lesson3/)  Memory Management, Structs, and Unions
Build solutions with custom data types using structs and master C memory management by exploring dynamic allocation, deallocation, and memory leaks through interactive exercises and hands-on practice.

### [**Lesson 4**](./lesson4/)  Debugging, Error Handling, and Other Tools in C
Enhance your C programming skills by mastering tools like File I/O, debugging, and error handling for robust and optimized code development.

### [**Final Project**](./final_project/)  File Compression Tool
In this hands on project, you'll develop a command line application that will accept flags to either run a compression or decompression algorithm on a file.
